%% This code is for illustration of changes in frequency domain with width of pulses. It generates two signals with their pulse widths are determined by some factors and these pulses are located randomly in signals. Then, it plots them in time and frequency domains.

%% Variables
fs = 8e5; % Sampling rate
num_pulses = 1000; % Number of pulses to integrate
factor = 100; % Width of pulses in first signal / Width of pulses in second signal
Time = 20; % Time duration of the signals
pulse_len = 3e-3; % Time duration of single pulse in signal 1
chance_of_location_ind = 10; % Ä°ncreasing this number increases the possibility to find a place for the pulses
t = 0:1/fs:Time-1/fs; % Time vector

%% Raised Errors
% Error if the number of samples covered by the pulse is smaller than 1 
if  pulse_len/factor*fs<1 || pulse_len*fs<1
    error("Sampling period is greater than the pulse width")
    
end

% Error if the number of samples covered by the pulse is larger than signal length 
if  pulse_len/factor*fs>length(t) || pulse_len*fs>length(t)
    error("Pulse width is greater than the frame")
